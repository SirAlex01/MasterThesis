To compensate for the lack of strong supervision signal, our model design is informed by patterns in language change documented in historical linguistics. The model utilizes an expressive sequence-to-sequence model to capture character-level correspondences between cognates. To effectively train the model in unsupervised manner, we innovate the training procedure by formalizing it as a minimum-cost flow problem. When applied to decipherment of Ugaritic, we achieve 5{\%} absolute improvement over state-of-the-art results. We also report first automatic results in deciphering Linear B, a syllabic language related to ancient Greek, where our model correctly translates 67.3{\%} of cognates."

To capture the statistical structure of the Mycenaean documents, we present a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network and compare it to the traditionally used n-grams. The model is used to supplement the damaged parts of the Mycenaean texts, namely the incomplete, to a greater or lesser extent, words, which are typically discovered on partially damaged clay tablets. We verify our method experimentally using ground-truth, then we demonstrate our results on real cases and compare with experts’ opinions. We also present a methodology to augment our dataset, which turns out to improve our results.},

It is one of several automatic metrics used in this year's shared task within the ACL WMT-07 workshop. This paper recaps the technical details underlying the metric and describes recent improvements in the metric. The latest release includes improved metric parameters and extends the metric to support evaluation of MT output in Spanish, French and German, in addition to English.},

We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.},

Translation Edit Rate (TER) measures the amount of editing that a human would have to perform to change a system output so it exactly matches a reference translation. We show that the single-reference variant of TER correlates as well with human judgments of MT quality as the four-reference variant of BLEU. We also define a human-targeted TER (or HTER) and show that it yields higher correlations with human judgments than BLEU{---}even when BLEU is given human-targeted references. Our results indicate that HTER correlates with human judgments better than HMETEOR and that the four-reference variants of TER and HTER correlate with human judgments as well as{---}or better than{---}a second human judgment does."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate WER, or e-WER, which does not require a gold-standard transcription of the test set. Our e-WER framework uses a comprehensive set of features: ASR recognised text, character recognition results to complement recognition output, and internal decoder features. We report results for the two features; black-box and glass-box using unseen 24 Arabic broadcast programs. Our system achieves 16.9{\%} WER root mean squared error (RMSE) across 1,400 sentences. The estimated overall WER e-WER was 25.3{\%} for the three hours test set, while the actual WER was 28.5{\%}."
